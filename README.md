Minestack
==========

Minestack is an open source project to deploy and control Minecraft Server Networks. Minestack combines Docker, MongoDB, 
RabbitMQ and NFS/GlusterFS to deploy and manage any size Minecraft Network.

### Why Minestack?

Minestack is a complete system that creats an easy hands on approach to managing your Minecraft Network. After the initial installation 
process anyone that can click a button on a website can easily configure Minestack and start deploying a Minecraft Network.
Using a service called Docker, Minestack is able to separate individual Minecraft and Bungee servers so if one has issues it will not
effect the whole network. Minestack is built using the widely accepted "Cloud Approach" where every system is built to handle failure.
If a Minecraft and Bungee server fails Minestack will instantly recreate and deploy a replacement server. If a Node fails servers will
automatically be moved to healthy Nodes.

### Fully Customizable

Do you need to add features or do you not like something Minestack does? Change it! Minestack is fully opensource and free to use. 
Need to hook into features from another Bukkit or Bungee plugin? Minestack gives full access to its database through a library called
Double Chest. Double Chest holds all the information that is needed to run your Minecraft Network.
